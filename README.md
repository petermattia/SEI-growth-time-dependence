Latest release: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/207391441.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/207391441)

This repository contains data and analysis for the manuscript "Rethinking the $t^{0.5}$ dependence of SEI growth", published in the *Journal of the Electrochemical Society* [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/ab8ce4).

- `SEI time dependence.ipynb` contains all analysis and figure creation used in the manuscript
- `SEI time dependence, F test CIs.ipynb` contains the same analysis but with profile-likelihood CIs instead of asymptotic approximate CIs (both yield similar results)
- `/figures` contains all figures used in the manuscript
- All other directories contain a screenshot of the figure from which data was extracted, as well as the extracted data.
