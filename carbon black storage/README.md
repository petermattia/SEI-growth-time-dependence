# SEI growth time dependence
## carbon black storage

Notes:
- `2018-01-22 carbon black self-delithiation data.xlsx` contains all data, directly taken from the BCS
- The individual `csv` files just separates out the sheets from the excel file into individual files
- The pre-cycling data is not included for the `50pt5` series
- `2pt5 cycles` is removed from the main text figure to make the legend fit, but included here for interest
